# QL-Basicode
Basicode-3 v2 for the Sinclair QL

This is an update of the original 1987 release. The code has been cleaned up and made compatible with SMSQ/E and SBASIC.
The BCROM build is meant to be placed into EPROM or other ROM-like memory and contains timing-critical routines for loading and
saving from cassette, using the native QL's NET interface.
The BCRAM build can be LRESPRed like any other extensions and contains only the code to load BASICODE programs from ASCII files.
